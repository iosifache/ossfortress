# Instructions

The following guide will assume you are following the most friction-less approach for setting up your environment, namely using the provided Docker Compose infrastructure. If you are using another approach, follow the guide and adapt the Docker-specific steps to your scenario.

## Types of tasks

The tasks are marked as follows:
- ✅: Recommended being followed;
- ❌: Avoidable due to time constraints or lack of difficulty; and
- ✌️: Optional, but fun to do if you have some spare time!
