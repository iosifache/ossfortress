# Mermaid diagrams

This folder holds the Mermaid projects for the diagrams used in the presentations and wiki. The folder with exported diagrams is in fact hosted in the wiki folder and symlinked here due to Docusaurus's inability to handle symlinks outside its root folder.

## Export

Just run `./export-diagrams.sh` from this folder.
